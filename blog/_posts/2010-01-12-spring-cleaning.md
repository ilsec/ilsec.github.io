During the end of 2009 I ended up taking a break from working on Ronin, and
shifted my efforts to other projects. Once 2009 came to a slow grinding
halt and made way for 2010, I decided to come back to Ronin and not let it
fall into disrepair. I and other Ronin developers compiled a list of the
radical changes we felt were necessary, in order to keep Ronin relevant.
Thus the [Spring Cleaning Campaign](http://groups.google.com/group/ronin-ruby/browse_thread/thread/d01f1fb4460d4b22#)
of 2010 was started.
