title: New API Documentation

If you have not heard yet, [lsegal](http://gnuu.org/) and
[zapnap](http://blog.zerosum.org/) have rolled out the new
[rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/) running
[YARD 0.6.0](http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/WhatsNew.md).

Not only does `rubydoc.info` look sharp, but it can
build YARD documentation for both [RubyGems](http://rubydoc.info/gems/)
released to [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org/) or
[GitHub](http://rubydoc.info/github/) repositories being actively developed.

We immediately leveraged `rubydoc.info` by making sure all Ronin
repositories had post-receive hooks to update their YARD documentation. Now
users can browse API documentation for both
[Ronin (Edge)](http://rubydoc.info/github/ronin-ruby/ronin/master/frames)
and previous releases of [Ronin](http://rubydoc.info/gems/ronin/frames).

Checkout the new API documentation links in the [docs](/docs/) section.
