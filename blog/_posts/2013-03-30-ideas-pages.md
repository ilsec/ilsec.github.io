Well, the deadline to submit Mentor Organization applications to [Google Summer
of Code 2013 (GSoC)][GSoC] crept up on us again. Unfortunately, we were unable
to submit an application in time. One of the requirements we were missing was
ideas for projects that Students could work on.

In order to prepare for Google Summer of Code 2014, we created Ideas pages on
the Wikis:

* [ronin](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin/wiki/Ideas)
* [ronin-asm](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-asm/wiki/Ideas)
* [ronin-bruteforcers](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-bruteforcers/wiki/Ideas)
* [ronin-exploits](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-exploits/wiki/Ideas)
* [ronin-scanners](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-scanners/wiki/Ideas)
* [ronin-sql](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-sql/wiki/Ideas)

If you have an idea for a cool feature that Ronin is currently missing,
add it to one of the Ideas pages. Who knows, someone might implement one of
your ideas sooner than you think. ;)
