title: Installing Ronin (Edge) Guide
author: postmodern
---

We just released a new [tutorial](/docs/install/edge.html), aimed at
developers and users who want to run the latest changes made to Ronin.

The Guide also touches on using the
[Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) to install
Ruby and using [Gem Bundler](http://www.gembundler.com/) to install the
dependencies of Ronin. Together, RVM and Gem Bundler, allows you to easily
run the edge version of Ronin right out of your home directory!
