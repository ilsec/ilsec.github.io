As listed in the [Spring Cleaning Campaign (2010)][1], a new website has been
designed for [Ronin](/). The new site is [Jekyll] based and hosted on
[GitHub].

Much of the website is written in [Markdown], which makes writting new content
a breeze. As always, we accept edits to the site, simply [fork] the site,
commit your changes and send one of the Ronin developers a pull-request.

You'll probably notice that we also added a few new sections to the site.
The [front page](/) now shows three random examples pulled from the [Examples]
section, illustrating some of the things Ronin can do in a few lines.
One can even subscribe to an [Atom feed] of the Examples, to get the latest
tricks.

The [Downloads] link in the menu now points to an actual downloads page,
containing links to `.tar.gz`, `.zip` and `.gem` files of Ronin.

Lastly, Ronin now has a [Developer Blog] with [DISQUS] powered comments.
