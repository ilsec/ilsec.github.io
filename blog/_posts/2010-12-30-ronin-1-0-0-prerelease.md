After more than a year of development, refactoring and new
features, Ronin 1.0.0.pre1 has been released:

    $ gem install ronin --pre

Since this is a prerelease, QA testing and [bug reports]
would be much appreciated. As bug-fixes stack up, we will release
additional prereleases for testing. Once the code stabilizes,
Release Candidates (RCs) will be released.

Instead of trying to release everything at once, we are following a
staggered [Release Schedule] split into in three phases. This allows us to get
the core libraries ([ronin-support], [ronin] and [ronin-gen]) immediately to
users.
