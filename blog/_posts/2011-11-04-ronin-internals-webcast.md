This Saturday (Nov. 5th) we will be giving a webcast on the internals of
[ronin-support][1], [ronin][2], [ronin-exploits][3] and [ronin-scanners][4].
The topics that we will cover are:

* Convenience methods in action
* Using the Ronin Database
* Ronin Repositories Explained
* Ronin Exploits and Payloads
* Ronin WebAttacks (LFI, RFI, SQLi)
* Ronin PostExploitation API
* Ronin Scanners

This webcast will take place from 16:00 PDT to 20:00 PDT. All Ronin webcasts are
free and requires no registration. Just go to
[yuuguu.com/share](http://yuuguu.com/share) and join the conference-call 
at **1-415-363-0849**, using the PIN **272335** for both.

This is the first time that we have done a Ronin webcast, and was a spur of the
moment decision. We will probably be doing more webcasts in the future, so don't
worry if you missed the first one. ;)

**Update:** The last 3rd of the webcast was [recorded][5], although the audio
quality is not the best.
