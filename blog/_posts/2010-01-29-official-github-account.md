While working on the [Spring Cleaning Campaign (2010)][1], I noticed that
Ronin had grown to 12 repositories. Being such a large and established project,
I realized it was high time to create an official GitHub account to host the
Ronin repositories.

From now on, the source for all Ronin repositories is [github.com/ronin-ruby].
