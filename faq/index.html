<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2 id="what">What is Ronin</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="what-language">What language is Ronin written in?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="supported-ruby-version">What version of Ruby should I run Ronin on?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    We recommend running Ronin on
    <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby 1.9.3-p0</a>
  </p>

  <p>Ronin can run on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>: >= 1.9.2, 1.8.7</li>
    <li><a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>: >= 1.5.1</li>
    <li><a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a>: >= 1.2.4</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, Ronin <strong>does not</strong> support Ruby 1.8.6,
    due it's poor performance and incompatibilities.
    If you are still using 1.8.6, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that
    you upgrade to either Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.2.

<h3 id="install-ruby">What is the easiest way to install Ruby?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p><a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">Ruby Version Manager (RVM)</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="learn-ruby">What are some good resources for learning Ruby?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">LearnToProgram</a>
    is an excellent book and tutorial which provides a solid
    introduction to Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's also the free and more technical
    <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Pragmatic Programmer's Guide to Ruby</a>,
    which many Rubyists first learned from.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're more of a hands-on learner, there is also the
    <a href="http://tryruby.org/">Try Ruby in your Browser</a> (Beta)
    interactive tutorial. If your still wanting more hands-on challenges,
    try <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="framework">Is Ronin a Framework?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Not exactly. Ronin can be thought of more as an Environment or Platform for
  code, exploits, payloads or research. Ronin provides the
  Convenience Methods, Database, libraries and a Repository System to
  package it all up.
  </p>

  <p>
  One of Ronin's design goals was to create a Platform that facilitated
  and encouraged third-party work.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="license">What is Ronin licensed under?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p><a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/">GPL-3</a></p>

  <p>
    Additionally, the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ronin-support">ronin-support</a>
    library is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL-3</a> license.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="docs">How well documented is Ronin?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin has extensive <a href="http://yardoc.org/">YARD</a>
  documentation covering it's <a href="/docs/#api">API</a>.
  Additional <a href="/docs/">guides and screencasts</a> are
  always in the works.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="cli">Does Ronin have a command-line interface (CLI)?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Why yes. Ronin's design allows for the libraries of Ronin
  to add sub-commands to the main <code>ronin</code> command.
  To view all available commands simply run the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ ronin help</code></pre>

  <p>To view the help information of a specific command:</p>
  <pre><code>$ ronin help command_here</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="irc">Does Ronin have an IRC Channel?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Join <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/ronin">#ronin</a> on
  <a href="http://freenode.net">irc.freenode.net</a>, or you can use the
  <a href="/irc/">Web Client</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="twitter">Does Ronin have a Twitter account for Announcements or Feedback?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ronin_ruby" title="@ronin_ruby">@ronin_ruby</a>
  on Twitter for announcements or to give feedback.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="builtin-exploits">Does Ronin have builtin exploits?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin does not ship with any builtin Exploits. Although, Ronin
  makes it rather easy to write your own exploits using
  <a href="https://github.com/gems/ronin-exploits">ronin-exploits</a>
  library and distribute them in <a href="#repos">Repositories</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  It takes a lot of time and energy to write and weaponize exploits
  for known vulnerabilities; let alone find new vulnerabilities.
  So, we decided to leave the exploit writing up to the skilled
  security researchers of the world, and let them decide how and when
  to distribute their own exploits.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="autopwn">Does Ronin provide an autopwn-like feature?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Ronin does not provide an <i>autopwn-like</i> feature.
    Features such as <code>autopwn</code> make assumptions about the
    workflow of a "real attacker", and attempt to automate it.
    Naturally, the "real attackers" will change their tactics and use
    new types of information gathering (ex: Datamining Social Networks)
    and attacks (ex: Phishing) which may not cleanly fit into existing
    Exploitation Frameworks; thus rendering <i>autopwn-like</i> features
    outdated and ineffective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ronin was designed to not impose a workflow onto the user.
    Instead, Ronin provides useful APIs, commands and a Database
    for the user to leverage however they want to.
  </p>
</div>
</section>

<h2 id="repos">Repositories</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="ronin-repo">What is a Ronin Repository?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin Repositories are very similar to RubyGems. They both can contain
  Ruby code in a <code>lib/</code> directory, command-line scripts in a
  <code>bin/</code> and data files in a <code>data/</code> directory.
  Ronin Repositories also have a <code>ronin.yml</code> metadata file and a
  <code>cache/</code> directory for exploits, payloads, scanners or anything
  else Ronin can cache into it's Database.
  </p>

  <p>
  Think of Ronin Repositoires as a quicker / less-formal way to organize your
  code.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="ronin-repo-hosting">How are Ronin Repositories hosted?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>

</div>

<h3 id="generate-ronin-repo">How can I generate a skeleton Ronin Repository?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  You can generate a skeleton Ronin Repository by simply running
  the following command provided by the
  <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ronin-gen">ronin-gen</a> library:
  </p>

  <pre><code>$ ronin-gen repository path/to/repo</code></pre>

  <p>If you wish to specify additional Repository metadata:</p>

  <pre><code>$ ronin-gen repository -n Repo-Name -L GPL-3 \

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<section class="faq">
<h3 id="readable-code">How readable is Ronin's code-base?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Other projects have been criticized for having poor
  programming conventions or a lack of documentation. To
  avoid this, Ronin follows the Ruby community's
  <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/ruby">style guidelines</a> to
  ensure that all source-code is clean, readable and maintainable.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="github">Where is Ronin's code-base hosted?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Ronin and it's many libraries are hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 id="test-suite">Does Ronin have a test-suite so that I can ensure that Ronin is bug free?</h3>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
  Yes, Ronin comes with extensive <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>
  specification tests.
  </p>

  <p>
  One can run the specification suite in any of Ronin's libraries, by running
  the following command:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$ rake spec</code</pre>
